# Langton's Ant

Langton's ant is a two-dimensional universal Turing machine with a very simple set of rules but complex emergent behavior. It was invented by Chris Langton in 1986 and runs on a square lattice of black and white cells.

This project tries to duplicate the machine in Godot Engine 3.3.2

## Movement Rules
- At a white square, turn 90° clockwise, flip the color of the square, move forward one unit

- At a black square, turn 90° counter-clockwise, flip the color of the square, move forward one unit

(Yes, I copied this from Wikipedia.)


## Installation

1. Download Godot Engine 3.3.2 from its [Website](https://godotengine.org) or [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/404790/Godot_Engine/)

2. Open it and in the project, list click on "Import", then, search
in the game folder, a file called project.godot, and click on "Import and Edit".

3. Done, you have access to the code in Godot Engine. You're free to modify it.
